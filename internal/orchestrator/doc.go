/*
Package orchestrator provides AI task orchestration capabilities for the Claude Company system.

This package implements a comprehensive task management system that coordinates multiple AI workers
to accomplish complex software development tasks. It follows a manager-worker pattern where an
orchestrator manages the overall workflow while individual workers handle specific implementation tasks.

Key Components:

1. Task Management:
   - Task creation, planning, and execution
   - Task status tracking and progress monitoring
   - Priority-based task scheduling
   - Task dependency resolution

2. Worker Management:
   - Worker registration and lifecycle management
   - Dynamic task assignment based on worker capabilities
   - Worker health monitoring and failover
   - Load balancing across available workers

3. Plan Management:
   - Automatic task decomposition and planning
   - Strategy selection (sequential, parallel, hybrid)
   - Resource estimation and optimization
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

4. Event System:
   - Real-time task progress notifications
   - Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
   - Pluggable event handlers and filters
   - Audit trail and logging

5. Storage:
   - Persistent task and plan storage
   - Event history and audit logs
   - Configuration management
   - Data consistency and integrity

Usage:

	// Create a new orchestrator instance
	orchestrator := orchestrator.New(config)
	
	// Start the orchestrator
	err := orchestrator.Start(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	// Create a new task
	req := orchestrator.TaskRequest{
		Type:        orchestrator.TaskTypeFeature,
		Title:       "Implement user authentication",
		Description: "Add OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens",
		Priority:    orchestrator.TaskPriorityHigh,
	}
	
	resp, err := orchestrator.CreateTask(ctx, req)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	// Monitor task progress
	events, err := orchestrator.Subscribe(ctx, []orchestrator.TaskEventType{
		orchestrator.TaskEventProgress,
		orchestrator.TaskEventCompleted,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	for event := range events {
		fmt.Printf("Task %s: %s\n", event.TaskID, event.Type)
	}

Architecture:

The orchestrator follows a layered architecture:

1. Interface Layer: Public APIs and contracts (Orchestrator, TaskPlanner, etc.)
2. Service Layer: Business logic and coordination
3. Storage Layer: Data persistence and retrieval
4. Worker Layer: Task execution and management

The system is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, with support for:
- Horizontal scaling through worker distribution
- Fault tolerance through task retry and failover
- Observability through comprehensive logging and metrics
- Extensibility through plugin architecture

Integration:

The orchestrator integrates with the Claude Company's tmux-based session management
to provide a seamless AI-powered development environment. It coordinates with:
- Session managers for workspace setup
- AI workers for code generation and analysis
- External tools and services for deployment
- Monitoring and alerting systems
